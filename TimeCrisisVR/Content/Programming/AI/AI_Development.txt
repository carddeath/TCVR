1. Create a function that is blueprint implementable in the EnemyAIController
2. Use this function in the BP to set the correct blackboard key values such as a go to point, escape point, advance point etc
3. Create 1 or more branches from the main selector to fullfil the state we want to create.
4. Create blackboard notes if required and use them as conditions 
5. If a delay is required a service can be used to check when a conition has changed
6. Create new tasks to have more advanced systems that will allow animation changes etc.
